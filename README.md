# 🇬🇧 UK Crime & Multiple Deprivation Analysis

This project explores the **UK Index of Multiple Deprivation** (IMD) dataset with a focus on **crime**, **income**, **employment**, **education**, and other factors that contribute to regional inequalities.

The goal is to understand how these deprivation domains interact and identify which areas are most affected by social and economic challenges.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze and visualize **crime distribution** across deciles of deprivation.
- Identify correlations between **crime, income, education, employment**, and **health**.
- Provide actionable insight through **data storytelling** and clean visualizations.

---

## 📊 Dataset Summary

The dataset used is the official UK **Index of Multiple Deprivation** from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Key features include:

- `Crime Decile`
- `Income Decile`
- `Education Decile`
- `Employment Decile`
- `Health Decile`
- `Living Environment Decile`

Each decile ranks areas from **1 (most deprived)** to **10 (least deprived)**.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Areas with high **crime decile** often have lower **income** and **employment** scores.
- Strong **negative correlations** were found between crime and both **education** and **income**.
- Certain local authorities consistently rank poorly across **multiple deprivation domains**.
